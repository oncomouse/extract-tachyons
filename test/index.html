While transhumanism is usually dismissed by scholars of rhetoric, technology, and culture as a fringe movement with limited scope, my project instead argues that “transhumanism” is a name for a much more pervasive rhetorical mode that considers technology as a vector for evolutionary change operating on society, consciousness, and biology. I call this rhetorical mode “evolutionary futurism,” and, in tracing this formation throughout 20th and 21st century culture, I suggest that transhumanism, rather than a fringe movement of renegade scientists and philosophers, is actually a postmodern form of Utopia in line with Fredric Jameson’s discussion of the concept in <em>Postmodernism</em>.</p><p>My book then traces the rhetorical, Utopian mode I call “evolutionary futurism” through a number of important moments in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p><p><strong>Chapters Summaries</strong></p><ol><li>The first chapter considers the origin of evolutionary futurism in continental modernism. Specifically, the chapter traces out the reception of Nietzsche’s <em>übermensch</em> as a figure for radical evolution rather than enlightened self-interest. Theosophist P.D. Ouspensky and Futurist Mina Loy are considered as guides for this particular uptake of Nietzsche.</li><li>The second chapter explores evolutionary futurist rhetoric in pre-WWII American science fiction during the “superman boom,” my term for the period immediately before and during the start of the war in which John W. Campbell solicited a considerable mass of stories about genetically evolved superhumans for his magazines. Concomitant to this publishing fad, SF fan culture also became intersted in actualizing this evolutionary futurist in its calls for an evolved “fannationalism.”</li><li>The third chapter is about the role of suffering and hedonism in an evolutionary futurism. Questioning the dominant transhuman rhetorical mode in which evolving beyond the human will be blissful, I explore the thinking of Teilhard de Chardin, the Jesuit who first coined the term “transhuman” in its modern usage, as a model for an evolutionary vanguard not tied to dubious notions of winner-take-all evolution.</li><li>The fourth chapter asks after aesthetics and evolutionary futurism. In the realm of high art, I consider the impact of Natasha Vita-More’s manifesto for transhuman art and the work of Arakawa and Gins, who adopt principles of evolutionary futurist rhetoric to art and architecture. I juxtapose this aesthetic with the “transhuman inaesthetic,” my term for the often bland and beige futurism of transhumanists such as Raymond Kurzweil and Zoltan Istvan. Finally, I conclude by arguing that this inaesthetic blinds many transhumanists to the evolutionary futurist aspects of online “low art” movements, such as meme culture.</li><li>The book concludes by discussing accelerationism and xenofeminism as recent examples of imagining an evolutionary futurist vanguard politics.</li></ol></div></div></div><div id=cv class="box w-col-1 research teaching expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class="thumbnail flex min-h-col-1 flex-column"><h1 class="cv-thumbnail self-center normal mv0">CV</h1><p>View my CV.</p></div><div class="content measure-cv center"><div class="cv-preamble db-ns dn"><h1 class="tc mt4">Andrew Pilsch</h1><p class="tc lh-copy"><strong>Associate Professor of English</strong><br>Department of English<br>Texas A&M University<br></p><p class="tc lh-copy"><script>for(coded="Ln2EtQ5@vLuY.ZaY",key="IWsTogjeBSUq8ix7h0twNlmZFf3d62XK5JvRHEuzbPcapyVC41AOD9YMGrQLnk",shift=coded.length,link="",i=0;i<coded.length;i++)-1==key.indexOf(coded.charAt(i))?(ltr=coded.charAt(i),link+=ltr):(ltr=(key.indexOf(coded.charAt(i))-shift+key.length)%key.length,link+=key.charAt(ltr));document.querySelector("p script").insertAdjacentHTML("afterend","<a href='mailto:"+link+"'>"+link+"</a>")</script><noscript>Sorry, you need Javascript on to email me.</noscript><br><a href=https://andrew.pilsch.com>https://andrew.pilsch.com</a></p></div><div class="cv-content db-ns dn"><h1 id=professional-experience>Professional Experience</h1><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th> </th><th> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Associate Professor</td><td>Texas A&amp;M University</td><td>2018-Present</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Professor</td><td>Texas A&amp;M University</td><td>2015-2018</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Professor</td><td>Arizona State University</td><td>2012-2015</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-Term Lecturer</td><td>Pennsylvania State University</td><td>2011-2012</td></tr><tr><td>Graduate Teaching Fellow</td><td>Pennsylvania State University</td><td>2005-2011</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=education>Education</h1><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th> </th><th> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PhD, English</td><td>Pennsylvania State University</td><td>May 2011</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Dissertation: <em>Transhumanism: Evolutionary Logic, Rhetoric, and the Future</em></li><li>Committee: Richard Doyle (Director), Jeffrey Nealon, Mark Morrisson, Robert Yarber.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th> </th><th> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MA, English</td><td>Pennsylvania State University</td><td>May 2007</td></tr><tr><td>BS, Computer Science</td><td>Georgia Institute of Technology</td><td>May 2005</td></tr><tr><td>BS, Science Technology &amp; Culture</td><td>Georgia Institute of Technology</td><td>May 2005</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=current-book-projects>Current Book Projects</h1><p><strong><em>Immutability: The World According to Software Bugs</em></strong></p><p><strong>Six Chapter Manuscript, In-Progress</strong> – This project is a media archeology of the computer bug.

I uncover that the accident is integral to software while mitigating this accidental nature has radically altered the landscape of contemporary culture. Planned chapters trace the software accident through the early mathematical foundations of computing, the 1990s emergence of home computing and the Internet, the collapse of post-structural thought and the related rise of infrastructure studies, recent changes in programming practices resulting from big data, and current discussions about the programmatic nature of reality itself.</p><p><strong><em>Forms of Digital Labor: Accounting for Work in the Information Age</em></strong></p><p><strong>Edited Collection, Co-Editing w/ Shawna Ross, 13 Chapter Drafts Collected, 2 Additional Solicited, &amp; In Talks with Publishers</strong> – <a href=https://oncomouse.github.io/digital-labor-cfp/ >CFP is online at: https://oncomouse.github.io/digital-labor-cfp/</a>.

In my dissertation, I write about “transhumanism,” a discursive community aimed at grappling with humans as objects of ongoing evolutionary processes. Often, these evolutionary processes have, specifically, to do with the evolutionary pressures exerted by new and emerging, digital technologies. As such, my motivation as a teacher is to better equip my students to deal with these pressures. Overall, I view my teaching as a chance to direct students in ways of living in a digital media ecology and preparing them for a future of ongoing, accelerating technological change.</p><p>This goal expresses itself differently, depending on the class being taught. For instance, in teaching Technical Communication, which I have done four times so far, I made an interesting discovery regarding my students and their attitudes towards writing. In conducting classroom discussion, I found that, thanks to Penn State’s various internship and co-op programs, my students mostly had experience writing in a professional, scientific capacity. What they lacked, however, was basic knowledge of digital document production. As such, I’ve retooled my teaching of this subject to focus on combining content production <em>and</em> document design. In this fashion, students spend as much time focusing on <em>how</em> they write as on <em>what</em> they write. The class includes assignments in both report writing and webpage design. I find that students benefit more from this approach, as they can leave my course with marketable, new media skills in addition to a better understanding of the rhetorical stakes of technical writing. More importantly, I stress the importance of developing digital problem solving strategies, rather than specific tool use, so that students in my classes can be better prepared for a changing, evolving digital workplace.</p><p>My teaching of science fiction, which is a new experience for me, affords another opportunity for dealing pedagogically with the tenants of transhumanism. Where the technical communications classroom becomes a workshop for applied transhumanism, I view the science fiction classroom as focusing on the philosophical implications of this discourse. By focusing on close analysis of various texts that grapple with the nature of a radically altered future, I attempt to direct students toward thinking seriously about the ethical, moral, and philosophical issues raised by the rapid technological change experienced by the United States following World War II (which corresponds to the high point of American SF). Additionally, as many of these processes of change and acceleration are ongoing (especially with regards to emerging Internet technologies and mobile computing), I view science fiction pedagogy as an opportunity to raise my students’ awareness that the issues raised in SF are, increasingly, being raised in their lives and their futures.</p><p>In both of these cases, I find focusing on the ongoing evolution of the human condition, by viewing my pedagogy from a transhuman perspective, both personally rewarding and hugely beneficial to my students in the classroom and beyond. While also helping them learn the course material at hand, my transhuman perspective allows students to step out of the classroom and the university with highly valuable “take-away” skills that can be applied in their future lives as students and as professionals. As such, I look forward to continue to explore this perspective in new and exciting pedagogical environments.</p></div></div></div><div id=ctm_review class="box w-col-1 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">Review of <em>Comparative Textual Media</em></h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 420px; height: 280px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/ctm_review.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Published Article</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p><a href=http://enculturation.net/comparative-textual-media>Review of <em>Comparative Textual Media</em> edited by N.

The article also argues that these new temporal rhythms represent potential mutations in the way standards are made and risk is managed in the post-national global economy.</p></div></div></div><div id=hypermonsters class="box w-col-1 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">Invoking Darkness</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 422px; height: 231px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/hypermonsters.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Published Article</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>This article argues for a turn-to-darkness in the rhetoric of the nonhuman.</p><p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/philrhet.50.3.0336?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">JSTOR Link</a>, <a href=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/666620>Project MUSE Link</a></p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><h1>Invoking Darkness: <em>Skotison</em>, Scalar Derangement, and Inhuman Rhetoric</h1><div class="measure center"><p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/philrhet.50.3.0336?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Read this article on JSTOR</a>. <a href=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/666620>Read this article on Project MUSE</a>.</p><p>This article argues that the turn to new materialism in rhetorical theory, specifically when inspired by object-oriented ontology, actually fills a need to address what this paper labels “boundless agencies”: ecosystems, climates, pandemics, economies, etc. Our object-centric language lacks rhetorical strategies for dealing with these new inhuman agencies and, as they come to dominant our cultural rhetoric, we lack persuasive strategies to address them. Instead of a model of object rhetoric focused on rhetorical carpentry (Brown and Rivers), a strategy that proposes the enlistment of simulating objects to understand the nonhuman, this article nominates Lanham’s concept of <em>skotison</em>—deliberately obfuscatory speech—as a key figure for rhetorically invoking these boundless agencies. Rhetorical invocation provides a strategy for thinking about the rhetoric of the inhuman, rather than the nonhuman, which is the more salient object for an extra-human rhetorical theory in our current age of horrors.</p></div></div></div><div id=insect-capital class="box w-col-1 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">Insect Capital</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 422px; height: 350px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/insect-capital.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Published Article</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>Uses the pattern of insect imagery in William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> to talk about a theory of corporate culture informed by German Media Studies.</p><p><a href=https://nanocrit.com/issues/issue8/insect-capital>Read the article online</a>.</p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><h1>Insect Capital</h1><div class="measure center"><p>Tracing an inhuman theory of the corporation, this article uses Friedrich Kittler’s understandings of media (that they shape humans, not the other way around) to argue that the corporation in postmodern, cyberpunk literature is a media form for adapting the human to the inhuman registers of global data.

I base Loy’s informatic futurism on discoveries made in translating her typographic fractals into HTML for online consumption. Loy’s usage of an informatic machine critiques both the masculine ethos of her Futurist interlocutors but also interrogates the rational afterlives of this machismo in web design practices that inherits principles developed by avant-garde movements. Thus Loy’s poetic account of machinic being serves as a potent site for exploring and resisting informatic rationality in the present.</p><p>Collection is edited by Shawna Ross and James O’Sullivan and published by Palgrave.</p></div></div></div><div id=homework-copia class="box w-col-1 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">Homework Copia</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/homework-copia.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Rhetorical Algorithm</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>A Twitter bot that invents homework excuses for the truly desperate.</p><p>Online at: <a href=http://oncomouse.github.io/homework-copia/ >http://oncomouse.github.io/homework-copia/</a><br>On Twitter at: <a href=https://twitter.com/HomeworkCopia>@HomeworkCopia</a></p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><h1>Homework Copia</h1><div class="measure center"><p>This project algorithmically generates an example of what Desiderius Erasmus called a copia.

With this indistinguishability in mind, this paper argues that minimal computing, as a paradigm for designing information systems, functions as a security measure against the proliferation of accidents documented by Virilio. In thinking about information systems and minimalism, I argue that one cluster in Jentery Sayers’s definitions of minimal computing is “minimal complexity,” a strategy for designing information systems to minimize accidents. This turn to minimal complexity, of which the turn to immutability in JavaScript development is one example, is a response to a recent, and dangerously overlooked, revision to the way we think about digital technology. Where Jean Baudrillard famously declared that media technology produce a desert of the real, recent work in infrastructure studies has instead manifested the jungle of the real in which we live. As ecologists know, jungles are densely entangled, information rich systems that sustain a staggering complexity of life forms. Where scholars of Baudrillard’s generation saw the digitization of life as an evacuation of the real, we find in studying infrastructure a tangle that sustains this virtuality that is rich in complexity and, also, ripe for accidents. As such, I conclude by proposing that minimal computing is a paradigm for securing infrastructure in an age of accidents.</p><p>Image Source: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dennism2/32861719652/in/photolist-S4SUnj-76Y6zH-cXXqXy-q1DJXA-qfWcPy-dbdGGh-pymswK-pVRDno-UTiRvS-dd2HhH-FbT2X3-QBzLox-qYiH81-bov2cY-YCnjLU-FsLLeC-dbdKCZ-inZCEU-4P2q52-dPcqJ1-mjhDwB-gSLReD-dTa6ng-inZMmu-mjhubJ-a1AiZb-qy6vh2-dJqaHa-fBvhjC-Hz8FCc-772ZsC-ccjB1w-7eirY9-9ixUfK-4Hrq53-62WDMu-a1xpCg-YNW7S7-cXMh9A-nWcVw9-G9QvSn-dUkzDb-a6BM2e-WK4Rsp-Hz8FMk-5PigdF-WUBGyT-YcimBE-bqaH2U-bD5D4e>DennisM2</a></p></div></div></div><div id=slsa17-jungle class="box w-col-2 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">The Jungle of the Real</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 421px; height: 198px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/slsa17-jungle.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Recent Presentation</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>Infrastructure studies uncovers that a jungle is growing where Baudrillard says a desert should lie.</p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><h1>The Jungle of the Real: Hacking Infrastructure After Baudrillard</h1><p><strong>Presentation At</strong>: <em>The Society For Literature, Science, and the Arts 2017 Conference</em>, Tempe, AZ</p><div class="measure center"><p>This paper considers the rise of infrastructure studies—scholarship that traces the materiality sustaining modernity—as a rebuttal to Jean Baudrillard’s claim in “Precision of the Simulacrum” that technology transforms the world into “the desert of the real.” Focusing on infrastructure, challenges the argument that media technology evacuates the world of meaning and returns a simulated media object. As the frequency of accidents reveal the fragility of our modernity, scholars in the humanities are discovering that underneath Baudrillard’s desert, a jungle has bloomed. In the tangle of cables, protocols, pipes, powerlines, and standards, we find amongst our insecure modernity a new real that sustains Baudrillard’s simulation. Thus, I conclude that infrastructure studies engages our assumptions of media as disembodiment and our understanding of the postmodern and beyond.</p><p>Image Source: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/comedynose/9519425490/in/photolist-fvcxxG-9BxNys-hX49P5-4fjTe2-769S1N-oz3Vi8-ozchAS-6AFbcN-bs8jzy-9j7wvM-cysCoN-aqTxQX-8f4hNA-azq16c-aUbuWe-471buY-bW3kGb-26oWLc-ouYv6h-eiBsLK-4CjMRF-qqhxgG-gqWmvw-9qhS3w-phGzPt-ooVpQA-ztVP-4Fgrcn-pcDVCD-nLdSPe-7a9Nsm-8injxP-qxZkka-4KrLFJ-o7bJyM-5Tfovc-b7j2sB-9X2fth-cNkqB-usH6W-ajYvQ8-9SKMAh-7MU1LT-7MXZZ7-5p9Asn-dSqacc-7FYsXo-oqxZxM-xNpe9-7vMVei>Pete</a></p></div></div></div><div id=slsa17-rocket class="box w-col-1 research expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">Rocket Into Darkness</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 428px; height: 219px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/research/slsa17-rocket.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Recent Presentation</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>Questions about the relationship between space in science and weird fiction and the radical construction of the future in contemporary theory.</p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><h1>Rocket Into Darkness: Accelerationism, Space, and the Future of the Future</h1><p><strong>Presentation At</strong>: <em>The Society For Literature, Science, and the Arts 2017 Conference</em>, Tempe, AZ</p><div class="measure center"><p>This paper contributes to the tensions between accelerationism and nihilism in contemporary theories of the future. I juxtapose theories of hope (represented by Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek’s “#ACCELERATE Manifesto”) and doom (represented by Eugene Thacker) as key examples of these two positions. Specifically, I explore space travel as a recurring motif in both bodies of work. Williams and Srnicek’s version of accelerationism, which could be summarized as “Communism with rocket ships,” connects the Marxist “way out is through” argument first identified by Benjamin Noys to contemporary science fiction tropes of space exploration, life extension, and mind expansion. In discussing this brand of accelerationism in conversation with Robert A. Heinlein, I show that Williams and Srnicek align with an older “rocket ship ideology” that saw space travel as atonement for Western humanism’s colonialist sins. On the other hand, Thacker’s brand of nihilism, informed by H.P. Lovecraft—who imagines Earth as an island from which humans should not stray—,is deeply suspicious of space beyond its dark, foreboding emptiness. To exemplify this view, I read Sam Kriss’s “Manifesto of the Committee to Abolish Outer Space” as a rebuttal to rocket ship ideology. Kriss figures space travel as an escape from our Earthly responsibilities to deal with oppression. I conclude by juxtaposing Kriss’s on rockets with Nick Land’s optimistic take on accelerationist nihilism to ask if, in our contemporary moment, we must not only confront our muddied future but also our technological ideologies.</p><p>Image Source: <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/16495356966/in/photolist-r8D1Wj-cBdx5W-9Wpo9J-3HnXyW-bfgtGB-GW6T2-6JpEum-f9uxY-mYj1c-2tZ3uK-FXHxv-U1iTsm-9aqrrK-eeNCZZ-6wWzLL-fMiNZL-aboGgw-rR2UWM-9bVLW2-xE2XcS-dKzFUY-a3X4ZS-iEn1vC-6jpEKj-99Qew7-pV2xpL-dEsp8S-jziEKq-eWGDpv-MGmmV-5fughY-bDYC2V-65rQ6r-KJUuz-dvn5zt-7GxTW1-9rWjGs-8U3vB4-5HyhEk-aaGKgw-9rTjf6-dGNMzj-aUfxyK-9rWnvq-bEvSX7-cnyMdb-7LUMGE-4ndbTc-8U3vsr-8U6yBu>Nasa Godard Space Flight Center</a></p></div></div></div><div id=about-site class="box w-col-1 info expand pointer overflow-auto min-h-col-1 bg-white pa1 ma-custom ba bb-thick br2 b--custom-gray"><div class=thumbnail><header class="flex flex-column-reverse"><h1 class="f3 mv0">About Site</h1><img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style="width: 240px; height: 171px;" class="lazy db center mv3 bg-mid-gray" data-src=/images/info/about-site.png><h2 class="f4 mv0">Info</h2></header><div class=lh-copy><p>Software used in development.</p></div></div><div class="content lh-copy"><div class="measure center"><h2 id=software-used-in-development>Software Used in Development</h2><p>This site is made using <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ >Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator for Ruby.
